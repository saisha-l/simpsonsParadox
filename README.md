### Simpson's Paradox: An interactive Simpson's themed website to teach people about the statistical paradox.
This website was created as an assignment for my INFO 270 class about data reasoning, and helps teach users about Simpson's Paradox. 

It's built on Next JS and React Frameworks, and utilizes ScrollyVideo.JS for animations.
